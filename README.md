<h2>Task</h2>

UI/UX design for landing page presenting a Data Science challenge which is happening on August 30, and being conducted by Skillenza.

<h3>Process</h3>

The concepts for the design are created within a particular general idea of a digital product but with all the passion and freedom for the designers’ artistic souls.

During the creative session for the design ideas of the landing page, I decided to apply the expressive and impactful potential of minimalism to the project along the use of Sans Serif, particularly condensed, geometric and somewhat rounded, fonts. Such fonts have a intricate nature of being ‘just-enough’ and deliver pivotal information with beautiful design aesthetics and without taking the attention away from the content itself. I chose Dosis as the primary font.

Since the page was dedicated to a Data Science Challenge, it was adeptly the best moment to incorporate the incredibly beautiful 'particles-js’ javascript library. It is a lightweight, dependency-free and responsive javascript plugin for particle backgrounds. I used the dynamic moving particles over a fixed image of a digital Earth to let the design communicate.

I use Twitter Bootstrap for my starting templates and design. It creates my development process easier for me to focus on the experience and interface instead.
FontAwesome icons were used for their minimal and condensed design.

To reduce the page load and time, I also decided to use another css library called animate.css for the little animation effects for different elements.

This is just the template page with the design, and as such, the links are dead.
